# scset-2025

Scripts to run the scSet model and reproduce analysis results.

The model can be run using the scripts in the 'scripts/' folder, which are for one clinical task presented in the paper, 'HLCA triple.'

Results can then be summarized and visualized using the review_results_paperresults.ipynb

In their current state, these scripts likely won't run on your machine without some modifications. They are intended to share details of our code and model setup, and we will improve usability and documentation prior to publication.
